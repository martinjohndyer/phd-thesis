\chapter*{Acknowledgements}

\begin{onehalfspace}

This is the very last thing I'm writing before submitting, because I'm awful at writing these sort of things and I kept putting it off. Not that it really matters, of the few people who will ever read this thesis I'm guessing most will skip over this bit. I always do.

Anyway, I'll start by thanking my PhD supervisor Vik Dhillon, for being a fantastic support and mentor over the past four years, as well as, when needed, a 5-star tour guide of La Palma. Thanks also to my second supervisor Ed Daw, who's Physical Computing class I enjoyed teaching and learning from for two and a half years, as well as Stu, Liam, Dave, Steven, James, Lydia, Pablo and others in the group in Sheffield. I'd also like to thank members of the GOTO collaboration: Danny, Krzysztof, Paul, Joe, James and Ryan at Warwick; Duncan, Kendall, Evert, Travis and Alex at Monash; Gav, Mark and everyone else from the ever-increasing list of member institutions (especially the poor students who had to babysit GOTO). Also Richard and Tim in Durham, who first put me in touch with Vik --- without them I literally would not be where I am today.

I'd like to thank the various friends I've made over the years from Maidenhead, Borlase, Durham and Sheffield; including, but not at all limited to, Alex, Anna, Becky, Ben, Emma, Gemma, Harriet, Harry, Héloïse, James, Katie, Mac, Oliver, Richard, Robin, Simon, Sophie and Varun (I wanted to include as many people as I could, I'm very sorry if I forgot you). A particular thanks to the other students in my year at Sheffield --- Becky, Héloïse and Katie --- for being the best compatriots I could have asked for.

Of course, I must also thank my Mum and Dad, and my brother Phil, for their unwavering support, as well as my Grandad Norman and cousin Nye.

Finally, I would like to acknowledge the people who did the most to encourage my love of physics and astronomy that eventually culminated in this thesis: my secondary-school physics teacher Malcolm Brownsell, the members of the Maidenhead Astronomical Society, and my maternal grandfather Eric ``Bubba'' Snelling. May you have clear skies.
