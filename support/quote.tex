% And now, Socrates, as you rebuked the vulgar manner in which I praised astronomy before, my praise shall be given in your own spirit. For every one, as I think, must see that astronomy compels the soul to look upwards and leads us from this world to another.
% Every one but myself, I said; to every one else this may be clear, but not to me.
% And what then would you say?
% I should rather say that those who elevate astronomy into philosophy appear to me to make us look downwards and not upwards.

% Do you still look through telescopes?
% Yes, astronomy's much more fun when you're not an astronomer. When I was an astronomer most of the time was spent making equipment, or making it work, or setting it up - or else typing away at computers to try to analyse the situation. The amount of time you spend actually looking at what you're doing is very small.
