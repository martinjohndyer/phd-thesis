%For everyone, as I think, must see that \\
Astronomy compels the soul to look upwards \\
and leads us from this world to another.

Astronomy's much more fun when \\
you're not an astronomer. %\\
%When I was an astronomer most of the time was spent \\
%making equipment, or making it work, or setting it up, \\
%or else typing away at computers to try to analyse the situation. \\
%The amount of time you spend actually looking at what you're doing is very small.
}{Brian May}{Vox interview, 1991 AD}
