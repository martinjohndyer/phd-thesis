\makequote{Astronomy's much more fun when you're not an astronomer. \\
When I was an astronomer most of the time was spent making equipment, or making it work, or setting it up, or else typing away at computers to try to analyse the situation.\\
The amount of time you spend actually looking at what you're doing is very small.}{Brian May}{Vox interview, 1991 AD}
