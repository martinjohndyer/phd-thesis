\section{Defining the sky grid}
\label{sec:gototile}
\begin{colsection}

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\begin{colsection}

GOTO-tile is a Python module (\pkg{gototile})\footnote{\url{https://github.com/GOTO-OBS/goto-tile}} created for the GOTO project to contain all of the functions related to tiling the sky and processing skymaps. It was originally developed by Darren White as a way to process gravitational-wave skymaps for GOTO, and then maintained by Evert Rol who rearranged it into a module usable for some other telescopes including SuperWASP on La Palma and a proposed southern GOTO node. My contributions to the module have been extensive: reworking the foundations to improve how the sky grid is defined and skymaps are applied, as well as adding additional code to create new skymaps (described in \aref{sec:grb_skymaps}).

\subsection{Creating sky grids}
\label{sec:grids}
\begin{colsection}

The core of GOTO-tile as it now exists is the \code{SkyGrid} Python class, which is used to define a sky grid: a collection of regularly-spaced points on the celestial sphere. These points are used as the centre of rectangular `tiles' aligned to the equatorial right ascension/declination coordinate system, which create a framework for survey observations to be mapped on to.

The most important parameter required when defining a sky grid is the field of view of the telescope, which is taken as the size of the tiles that make up the grid. The field of view is defined within GOTO-tile by giving a width and height value in degrees, meaning the tiles can only be square or rectangular. This is typically fine for the GOTO array, which has a total field of view comprising of overlapping rectangles from each unit telescope (see \aref{fig:fov}). There was a period when having three unit telescopes in an `L'-shape was considered, but this was abandoned due mainly to the complexity of tiling the grid based on abstract shapes. For the prototype 4-UT GOTO system currently on La Palma a rectangular \SI{3.7}{\degree} $\times$ \SI{4.9}{\degree} tile was defined during commissioning, see \aref{fig:4ut_footprint}.

The second parameter required to define a sky grid is the desired overlap between the tiles. This is given as a value between zero and one in both the right ascension and declination axes, with zero meaning no overlap and one meaning all the tiles are completely overlapping (in practice the overlap is restricted to no more than $0.9$). The overlap is used to define the spacing between the tile centres, depending on the algorithm used. The current 4-UT grid uses an overlap of 0.1 (10\%) in both axes.

As GOTO-tile has been developed the algorithm used to define the grid has changed (see \aref{sec:algorithms}), but the basic method remained the same:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item On the celestial sphere (\aref{fig:sphere}) equally spaced lines of constant declination are defined, separated by the value $\Delta\delta$ (\aref{fig:deltadelta}). These ``declination strips'' are the basis for the grid points, which the tiles are centred on.
    \item Each declination strip is then filled with equally spaced points separated by the value $\Delta\alpha$ (\aref{fig:deltaalpha}). This value is constant within each strip but is (in most algorithms) a function of declination $\Delta\alpha(\delta)$, meaning that as one moves away from the equator towards the poles each strip will contain a fewer number of points.
    \item These points are then defined as the centres of the tiles, the size of which is given by the field of view (\aref{fig:tiledsphere}).
\end{enumerate}

Once the grid has been created it is encapsulated within the GOTO-tile \code{SkyGrid} class. Each tile is defined by a coordinate at its centre, and each is also given a unique name of the form \code{T0001}. The grid itself is also given a name formed using the input field of view and overlap parameters, so the current  grid (with a field of view of \SI{3.7}{\degree}$\times$\SI{4.9}{\degree} and overlap factor of 0.1 in both axes) is given the name \code{allsky-3.7x4.9--0.1--0.1}. In this way a given tile in a given grid can be recreated just from the grid and tile name, which is used when storing the details in the \code{grids} and \code{grid\_tiles} tables in observation database (see \aref{sec:obsdb}). % chktex 29

\subsection{Different gridding algorithms}
\label{sec:algorithms}
\begin{colsection}

There have been three different algorithms used by GOTO-tile to define the grid.

% ---------
\subsubsection{The product algorithm}

The first has since retroactively been called the ``\textbf{product}'' algorithm, and was used when Darren White first wrote GOTO-tile. It first defines the declination step size as
%
\begin{equation}
    \Delta\delta = f_\text{dec}(1-v_\text{dec}),
    \label{eq:product_deltadelta}
\end{equation}
%
where $f_\text{dec}$ and $v_\text{dec}$ are respectively the field of view in degrees and the fractional overlap parameters in the declination direction. The declination strips are then defined by taking steps of this size from the equator towards the poles, stopping when $|\delta| > 90$. An equivalent formula is used to calculate the steps in right ascension

\begin{equation}
    \Delta\alpha = f_\text{RA}(1-v_\text{RA}).
    \label{eq:product_deltaalpha}
\end{equation}

The clear downside of this method is that $\Delta\alpha$ does not vary with declination. In effect this algorithm attempts to define the grid as if it was on a flat plane, where the tiles could be arranged in orthogonal rows and columns. In practice when applied to a sphere this leads to a vast number of redundant tiles at the poles, as shown in \aref{fig:product}.

% ---------
\subsubsection{The cosine algorithm}

Due to the obvious problems with the product algorithm, a replacement was written by Evert Rol, which I have since called the ``\textbf{cosine}'' algorithm. It is a more refined version of the product algorithm, and the declination strips are calculated in the same manner using \aref{eq:product_deltadelta}. However \aref{eq:product_deltaalpha} is modified to depend on declination:
%
\begin{equation}
    \Delta\alpha(\delta) = \frac{f_\text{RA}(1-v_\text{RA})}{\cos \delta}.
    \label{eq:cosine_deltaalpha}
\end{equation}

This produces a more sensible grid with fewer redundant tiles at the poles, as shown in \aref{fig:cosine}. However, there remained an issue of asymmetry: the strips are arranged increasing and decreasing from $\delta=0$ and the tiles are then arranged within the strips starting from $\alpha=0$. This leads to varying levels of overlap when the tiles within the strips meet as $\alpha$ approaches \SI{360}{\degree}, as visible in \aref{fig:cosine}. Although more subtle, there are similar issues at the north and south celestial poles. It is also common for there to be small gaps between the tiles at high and low declinations.

% ---------
\subsubsection{The minverlap algorithm}

Due to these problems I created a new method to create the grid, called the ``\textbf{minverlap}'' (\emph{min}imum o\emph{verlap}) algorithm. A grid created with this algorithm is shown in \aref{fig:minverlap}. The intention of the new algorithm was to solve the issues with the product and cosine algorithms by dynamically adjusting the spacing between tiles. The previous two algorithms both treated the user-specified overlap parameter as fixed, and if the resulting spacings did not give an integer number of tiles within the ranges available then they produced uneven gaps at the edges. This is shown more clearly in \aref{fig:cosine_spacing}, where a particular spacing results in gaps at the celestial poles and variable overlaps across the RA$=0$ meridian.

The minverlap algorithm solves these problems by treating the overlap parameter not as fixed but as the \textit{minimum} required overlap between tiles. For example, if a grid is requested with an overlap of $0.2$ (20\%) but the field of view of the tiles does not neatly divide by \SI{90}{\degree} then the overlap can be increased until an integer number of tiles fit, as shown in \aref{fig:minverlap_spacing}.

The final strips are \SI{6.8}{\degree} from the poles, as this is more than half of the field of view (\SI{6.5}{\degree}) the poles themselves will not by within the area of any tile. \aref{eq:cosine_deltaalpha} gives $\Delta\alpha = $ \SI{10.4}{\degree} on the equator ($\delta=0$). This results in 35 points arranged as shown in the polar view on the right, and a reduced spacing of \SI{6.4}{\degree} to the west of the $\alpha=0$ meridian. This remainder will be different for each strip, as shown in \aref{fig:cosine}.

    }\label{fig:minverlap_spacing}
\end{figure}

\clearpage

To define the grid points using the minverlap algorithm, it is first necessary to find the number of tiles $n$ that would fit into the available range using the cosine algorithm spacing; if this is not an integer number of tiles then round it up to the next whole number. In declination this is calculated as
%
\begin{equation}
    n_\text{dec} = \left \lceil \frac{90}{f_\text{dec}(1-v_\text{dec})} \right \rceil,
    \label{eq:minverlap_ndec}
\end{equation}
%
where $\lceil x \rceil$ is the mathematical ceiling function. This is a modification of \aref{eq:product_deltadelta}, but one that will always find an integer number of tiles. For example, for a tile with a declination field of view $f_\text{dec} = $ \SI{13}{\degree} and overlap $v_\text{dec} = 0.2$ \aref{eq:product_deltadelta} gives $\Delta\delta = 13 \times (1-0.2) = $ \SI{10.4}{\degree}. This clearly does not divide into \SI{90}{\degree} without a remainder, \SI{6.8}{\degree}, as shown in \aref{fig:cosine_spacing}. The problem is that \SI{90}{\degree} $/$ \SI{10.4}{\degree} $= 8.65$, so the product and cosine algorithms will fit in 8 declination strips and then have over half the height of a tile remaining at the poles. Instead, the minverlap algorithm rounds this up to $n_\text{dec} = 9$ and then calculates the spacing using
%
\begin{equation}
    \Delta\delta = \frac{90}{n_\text{dec}}.
    \label{eq:minverlap_deltadelta}
\end{equation}

In this case the new $\Delta\delta = $ \SI{10}{\degree}, which gives an even arrangement of tiles from the equator to the poles, as shown in \aref{fig:minverlap_spacing}. The other benefit of this method is that, in addition to there always being a declination strip at $\delta=0$, there will always be ``strips'' at \SI{+90}{\degree} and \SI{-90}{\degree}, which results in a single tile being located over the celestial poles and ensuring there are no major gaps in coverage.

In the minverlap algorithm the spacing in right ascension is treated in a simula way. The integer number of tiles that can fit into a given declination strip is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    n_\text{RA}(\delta) = \left \lceil \frac{360}{f_\text{RA}(1-v_\text{RA})/\cos \delta} \right \rceil + 1,
    \label{eq:minverlap_nra}
\end{equation}
%
where the $+1$ is  to account for tiles being located both at $\alpha=$\SI{0}{\degree} and $\alpha=$\SI{360}{\degree}. The logic is exactly the same as with declination, and the revised spacing is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    \Delta\alpha(\delta) = \frac{360}{n_\text{RA}(\delta)}.
    \label{eq:minverlap_deltaalpha}
\end{equation}

This spacing is also shown in \aref{fig:minverlap_spacing}, with the grid points uniformly spaced around the celestial equator. Note that the ceiling function does mean that in some cases strips at different declinations can have the same number of tiles. For example, using the same parameters as previously $\Delta\delta=$\SI{10}{\degree}, so declination strips start at \SI{0}{\degree} and continue to \SI{\pm10}{\degree}, \SI{\pm20}{\degree} \ldots (mirrored in both hemispheres). From \aref{eq:minverlap_nra} the number of tiles on the equator is $n_\text{RA}(\delta=\SI{0}{\degree}) = \lceil 360/(10.4/\cos \SI{0}{\degree})) \rceil + 1 = \lceil 34.6 \rceil + 1 = 36$. But on the next strip up (or down) $n_\text{RA}(\delta=\SI{\pm10}{\degree}) = \lceil 360/(10.4/\cos(\pm\SI{10}{\degree})) \rceil + 1 = \lceil 34.1 \rceil + 1 = 36$ as well. This occurs because there are only a limited number of ways to fit an integer number of fixed tiles into a given declination strip, and so, as shown in \aref{fig:minverlap}, the three strips around the equator align perfectly with the same number of tiles.

% ---------
\subsubsection{Limitations of the minverlap algorithm}

The new minverlap algorithm is a significant improvement on the previous gridding algorithms. In particular it reduces the occurrences of gaps in coverage close to the poles which occur when using the cosine algorithm. However gaps can still occur when using the minverlap with a particularly low overlap parameter. For example, \aref{fig:tiledsphere} shows a sphere tiled using the minverlap algorithm with an overlap parameter of 0 and in this case gaps are visible just below the northern celestial pole.

A proposed solution to this problem would be to force tiles to meet at their lower corners (in the northern hemisphere; upper corners in the south), therefore overlapping further and removing the possibility of gaps forming due to the angle between the tiles. An attempt to make this change and create an ``enhanced minverlap'' algorithm was tested, however ultimately it proved unnecessary. Although the current minverlap algorithm is deficient at low overlap values, this is only an issue when used with large tiles. The \SI{10}{\degree} $\times$ \SI{10}{\degree} tiles and 0 overlap used for \aref{fig:tiledsphere} are extreme values, and even for the roughly \SI{8}{\degree} $\times$ \SI{5}{\degree} full field of view of GOTO with 8 unit telescopes the overlap has to be less than 0.1 before noticeable gaps start appearing.

A further possible improvement to the minverlap algorithm has also been identified since it was implemented. Instead of locating two grid points precisely at the celestial poles (i.e.\ using declination strips at $\pm$\SI{90}{\degree}) as show in \aref{fig:minverlap_spacing}, it would instead be enough to have the highest/lowest declination strips exactly half of the field of view away from the poles. This would ensure the poles were still included within the tiled area, at the top/bottom of the highest/lowest strip, but could reduce the number of strips needed to cover the entire sphere.

As it happens, when viewed from La Palma, the northern celestial pole is below the GOTO altitude limit of \SI{30}{\degree}. This means that tiles closest to the pole are not visible, and so the issues described above are irrelevant. Should GOTO-tile be applied in the future to other telescopes at other sites then this issue would need to be revisited, but it was not a priority to fix within the context of this work.

\section{Probability skymaps}
\label{sec:skymaps}
\begin{colsection}

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\begin{colsection}

When identifying a particular target in the sky coordinates can be given in right ascension and declination, and if there is some uncertainty in the position then errors can be given on the coordinate values. For example, a \glsfirst{grb} event detected by the \textit{Fermi} \glsfirst{gbm} might have a central position and an error radius ranging from arcseconds to tens of degrees. However, multiple gravitational-wave detectors produce large and distinctly asymmetric localisation areas (see \aref{sec:gw_localisation}). For these cases, the \glsfirst{lvc} produce probability skymaps which map the localisation area onto the celestial sphere. This section describes how these skymaps are defined and how they are mapped onto the GOTO all-sky grid as described in \aref{sec:gototile}.

\end{colsection}

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsection{Defining skymaps with HEALPix}
\label{sec:healpix}
\begin{colsection}

\glsfirst{healpix} is a system used to define pixelised data on the surface of a sphere~\citep{HEALPix}. Developed at NASA JPL for microwave background data, it is now widely used for other applications including for gravitational-wave skymaps produced by the LVC.\@ HEALPix divides the sphere into a series of nested (hierarchical), equal-area (although not equal-shape) pixels arranged in declination strips (``isoLatitude''). The first four orders of spheres are shown in \aref{fig:healpix}, starting from a base resolution with 12 pixels and increasing as each pixel is split into four.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=0.7\linewidth]{images/healpix.pdf} %\todo{recolour??}
    \end{center}
    \caption[HEALPix partitions of a sphere]{
        The first four orders of the HEALPix partition of a sphere, with increasing $N_\text{side}$ resolution parameter. Note that as the resolution doubles each pixel on the previous sphere is split into four, and $N_\text{side}$ is the number of pixels along the side of a first-order pixel (two of which are highlighted). Adapted from \citet{HEALPix}.
    }\label{fig:healpix}
\end{figure}

The resolution of the HEALPix grid is defined using the $N_\text{side}$ parameter, which for the given resolution is the number of pixels along each side of one of the 12 base pixels. At every resolution each first-order pixel contains $N_\text{side}^2$ pixels, so the total number of pixels in a sphere is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    N_\text{pix} = 12 N_\text{side}^2.
    \label{eq:healpix_npix}
\end{equation}
%
Each pixel therefore has an equal area of
%
\begin{equation}
    \Omega_\text{pix} = \frac{4\pi}{12 N_\text{side}^2} = \frac{\pi}{3 N_\text{side}^2},
    \label{eq:healpix_area}
\end{equation}
%
on a unit sphere where the radius $r=1$. Taking the celestial sphere, the circumference in degrees is $\SI{360}{\degree} = 2 \pi r$ meaning the area of the whole sky is given by
%
\begin{equation}
    A_\text{sky} = 4 \pi r^2 = 4 \pi \left ( \frac{\SI{360}{\degree}}{2 \pi} \right )^2 = \frac{129600}{\pi}~\text{sq deg} \approx 41252~\text{sq deg} , %chktex 3
    \label{eq:sky_area}
\end{equation}
%
and therefore the area of each HEALPix pixel is
%
\begin{equation}
    A_\text{pix} = \frac{129600}{12 \pi N_\text{side}^2}~\text{sq~deg} \approx \frac{3438}{N_\text{side}^2}~\text{sq~deg}.
    \label{eq:healpix_area_degrees}

\aref{fig:healpix} shows only the first four orders of HEALPix pixelisation, up to $N_\text{side} = 8$ where the sphere is split into 768 pixels each with an area of 53.7~sq deg. An initial, low-resolution LVC skymap might use a grid with $N_\text{side} = 64$ (approximately 49 thousand pixels) and each with an area of 0.84~sq~deg, whereas a final output skymap will have $N_\text{side} = 1024$, 12.5 million pixels and a pixel size resolution of $3.27 \times 10^{-3}$~sq~deg (11.7~square~arcminutes).

In addition to being a way to divide the sphere, each HEALPix pixel has a unique index from one of two different numbering schemes: either the ring (counting around each ring from the north to the south) or nested (based on the sub-pixel tree) system.

HEALPix is used to provide localisation of sky probabilities for transient astronomical events, in the form of ``skymaps''. Each point on the HEALPix grid is assigned a probability between 0 and 1 that the counterpart object is located within that pixel, and the whole sphere should sum to unity. \aref{fig:skymap_regrade} shows a typical LVC skymap, for the gravitational wave event S190521r\footnote{Downloaded from \url{https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/S190521r}}, at various HEALPix $N_\text{side}$ parameters.

\end{figure}

As well as the individual probabilities assigned to each pixel, it is also useful to consider the overall spread of the probability. This is done by considering the probability contour areas, typically at the 50\% and 90\% levels. The 50\% contour area of a skymap is defined by encircling the smallest number of pixels so that the total probability within the area is 50\% of the overall skymap probability. When a skymap is processed using GOTO-tile each pixel is assigned a contour value as well as its individual probability value. This is calculated by sorting all of the pixels by probability from highest to lowest, and the contour value for each pixel is then the cumulative sum of the probability within the pixels above it. This contour value can be considered as the lowest contour area that each pixel is within, meaning the pixels that are contained within the 50\% contour area are those with contour values of less than 50\%. \aref{fig:sim_skymap_probs} and \aref{fig:sim_skymap_conts} illustrate how the contours are calculated for a cartoon 2-dimensional skymap.

\subsection{Mapping skymaps onto the grid}
\label{sec:mapping_skymaps}
\begin{colsection}

When gravitational-wave signals are detected the LVC analysis pipelines create HEALPix skymaps to describe the sky localisation, and these are then distributed with the public VOEvent (see \aref{sec:voevents}). GOTO-tile is used to map the skymaps onto the grid used for the all-sky survey (defined in \aref{sec:gototile}). This requires finding which HEALPix pixels fall within each tile, which is done by defining polygons that match the projected tile areas and using the \code{query\_polygon} function from the Python healpy module\footnote{\url{https://healpy.readthedocs.io}}. For each tile it is then simple to sum the probability of all the HEALPix pixels within it, which gives the total contained probability. This is shown for a cartoon skymap in \aref{fig:sim_skymap_tiles}. In cases where grid tiles overlap a given HEALPix pixel could fall within the area of multiple tiles, and therefore that pixel would contribute to the total probability of more than one tile. This means the total contained probability within all tiles can add to more than 100\%.

\subsection{Selecting tiles}
\label{sec:selecting_tiles}
\begin{colsection}

When a gravitational-wave event is processed event pointings are added into the observation database as described in \aref{sec:event_insert}. However, only a certain number of pointings should be added to prevent GOTO wasting too much time observing low-probability areas. Each pointing is mapped to a grid tile, and only tiles with a reasonably high contained probability are worth observing. The GOTO-alert event handling code described in \aref{chap:alerts} selects tiles based on their contour level, meaning GOTO could, for example, chose to observe the 90\% contour of each skymap. However, determining which contour level each tile is within is not as simple as calculating the contained probability, as there are multiple ways to define the contour value for each tile.

For example, a tile could be defined as being within a given contour area if \textit{every} pixel contained within that tile is within that contour. However this is unreasonable for large tiles, such as GOTO's, as the tile areas are often wider than the long, stretched out probability areas seen in typical gravitational-wave typical skymaps. An alternative then would be say that a tile is within a contour if \textit{any} of its contained pixels are within the contour. However, this will find every tile covering the contour area even if only the smallest fraction of the tile's area is within that region, which leads to over-selecting tiles. Several alternative methods were considered, including taking the median or mean of the contained pixel contour levels within each tile. Some different selection methods applied to the S190521r skymap are shown in \aref{fig:selecting_tiles}. The chosen method used within GOTO-alert is to select all tiles which have a mean contour value within 90\%. However, more quantitative simulations of different skymaps could be used to determine if this is the optimal choice for all cases.

        In the upper left the skymap is plotted on the celestial sphere, forming the ``banana'' shape typical of gravitational-wave localisations, and the 50\% and 90\% probability contours are shown.
        The other three plots show grid tiles selected using one of three methods: selecting tiles to cover the entire 90\% skymap (\textcolorbf{NavyBlue}{blue}), selecting tiles with a median contour value of 90\% (\textcolorbf{Orange}{orange}) and selecting tiles with a mean contour value of 90\% (\textcolorbf{Green}{green}). The number of tiles selected ($n$) and total probability within them ($P$) is given.
        The mean contour method provides a good compromise, selecting fewer than half of the tiles needed to cover the whole 90\% contour (31 compared to 63), but together they still contain nearly 87\% of the total probability.

\aref{fig:170817_gw} shows an example of GOTO-tile applied to the skymap for the GW170817 event \citep{GW170817}. The points within each tile were identified and summed in order to find the total contained probability within each tile. There is some redundancy due to the overlap between tiles, however this is typically negligible (the final GW170817 skymap used was notably smaller than usual LVC skymaps due to the coincident \textit{Fermi} localisation, which makes the overlaps more pronounced).

\section{Creating skymaps for GRB events}
\label{sec:grb_skymaps}
\begin{colsection}

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\begin{colsection}

\todo{galaxies here --- go to ``creating custom skymaps''?}

This system described in the previous sections works well for gravitational wave events using LVC skymaps, and it has since ben expanded to other types of events. As part of the commissioning observations (\todo{see commissioning}) when the LIGO-Virgo detectors were down GOTO also followed-up \gls{grb} events from the \textit{Fermi} satellite \gls{gbm} \citep{Fermi_GBM}. These events however do not include probability skymaps, instead they only include a central right ascension, declination and error radius. Yik Lun Mong and I developed code in order to create a skymap from these Fermi events, therefore allowing them to be processed by GOTO-tile using the same methods already created for gravitational wave events.

\end{colsection}

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsection{Gaussian skymaps}
\label{sec:gaussian_skymaps}
\begin{colsection}

Instead of loading a skymap from a FITS file, a function was written to create a probability skymap based on a 2D Gaussian profile. First, the error radius ($r$, the 68\% containment radius) is converted into the standard deviation of the distribution $\sigma$ using

\begin{equation}
    \sigma = \frac{r}{\sqrt{2.3}}.
    \label{eq:gaussian_sigma}
\end{equation}

The distance $d$ between a given point on the sphere ($\alpha, \delta$) and the central coordinates of the distribution ($\alpha_c, \delta_c$) is given by

\begin{equation}
    \sin^2 \left ( \frac{1}{2} d \right )
    = \sin^2 \left ( \frac{\delta-\delta_c}{2} \right)
      + \cos (\delta) \cos (\delta_c) \sin^2 \left ( \frac{\alpha-\alpha_c}{2} \right),
    \label{eq:gaussian_distance}
\end{equation}

and the probability at each point is given by

\begin{equation}
    P(\alpha, \delta) = \frac{1}{2\pi\sigma} \exp \left ( \frac{d^2}{2\sigma^2} \right ).
    \label{eq:gaussian_prob}
\end{equation}

In order to create a HEALPix skymap this probability is calculated for every point on the grid, which creates the skymap array. This can then be processed with GOTO-tile exactly like an LVC skymap.

Using this above method, skymaps can be created for any single-target alert that has a given error radius. Several sources of transient events, such as \textit{Gaia} or \textit{Swift}, produce very well-localised events with error regions well below the field of view of GOTO, so creating skymaps is less important. The skymaps for \glspl{grb} from \textit{Fermi} however cover much larger areas. For example, the \gls{gbm} detection of GRB~170817A that helped localise the GW170817 gravitational wave detection produced an initial alert with an error radius of \SI{17.45}{\degree}, later reduced to \SI{11.58}{\degree} in the final alert\footnote{GCN Notices available at \url{https://gcn.gsfc.nasa.gov/other/524666471.fermi}}, which corresponded to a 50\% confidence region of $\sim$500~square~degrees \citep{GW170817_Fermi}. The error values given in \gls{gbm} GCN Notices however only account for statistical errors for that event, not systematic errors. The \gls{gbm} systematic errors are described in \citet{Fermi_localisation} to be well modelled by a core Gaussian with a radius of \SI{3.71}{\degree} and a non-Gaussian tail extending to \SI{14}{\degree}. For the purposes of GOTO tiling the tail is ignored, and a single Gaussian is produced with an error radius simply combining the statistical radius ($r_\text{notice}$) and this  systematic profile in quadrature as

\begin{equation}
    r = \sqrt{r_\text{notice}^2 + {(\SI{3.71}{\degree})}^2}.
    \label{eq:fermi_radius}
\end{equation}

This radius is then used with \aref{eq:gaussian_sigma} onwards to create the Gaussian skymap. It should be noted that in reality the probability areas from \textit{Fermi} are not perfectly symmetric Gaussian profiles, but until \gls{gbm} events start being published with \gls{healpix} skymaps this works as a reasonable approximation. For GRB~170817A the skymap and tiling solution is shown in \aref{fig:170817_grb}. Note that the source location falls quite far out of the peak of the \gls{grb} skymap, and had there not been the coincident gravitational wave detection it would be unlikely that the source of the gamma-ray burst would have been observed.

The tiles highlighted in red each contain more than 1\% of the probability instead of 5\% used in \aref{fig:170817_gw}, due to the greater spread of the skymap meaning no tile here contains more than 5\%.
