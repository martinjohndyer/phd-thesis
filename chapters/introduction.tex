\begin{colsection}

Einstein's theory of General Relativity describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime \citep{Einstein1914}, and he went on to describe the propagation of distortions within the spacetime `fabric' \citep{Einstein1916}. These \emph{gravitational waves} (GWs) are produced by the acceleration of matter within the field of spacetime and propagate at the speed of light, analogous to electromagnetic (EM) waves being produced by a moving charge. The existence of gravitational waves is a consequence of the finite propagation time of gravity in general relativity, there is no analogue to gravitational waves in Newtonian gravity as Newton described a force propagating instantaneously.

The full theory of gravitational waves is beyond the scope of this thesis, but the result of Einstein's quadrupole equations is that gravity propagates as a transverse wave that alternately stretches and compresses spacetime in orthogonal axes \citep{BIGcardiff}. Gravitational waves have two polarisation states, plus ($+$) or cross ($\times$), as shown in \aref{fig:wave}. A single object will never `observe' a gravitational wave, the only way to detect the passing of gravitational waves is to look for changes in the relative positions of two or more objects. The magnitude of these perturbations is described as the strain, $h$. It is the goal of gravitational wave detectors to observe these minute spatial perturbations as the wave passes through.

The upper image shows the effect of a plus-polarised wave, the lower image shows the effect of a cross-polarised wave.

\subsection{Sources of gravitational waves}
\label{sec:gw_sources}
\begin{colsection}

Any accelerating mass will generate gravitational waves as it moves through spacetime, as long as the motion is not spherically symmetric (e.g.\ a rotating disk or a uniformly expanding sphere) \citep{BIGcardiff,BIGparis}. In practice it is impossible to detect gravitational waves from anything but the most massive cosmological objects moving at the fastest speeds, as only they will produce strains that are at all detectable.

A continuous source of gravitational waves will be generated by two massive objects orbiting one another \citep{GW_sources}, and the loss of energy from the system in the form of gravitational waves will slowly cause the orbiting distance of the two objects to shrink. The first binary pulsar was discovered in 1974 \citep{HulseTaylor}, and after repeated observations it was apparent that the orbital period of the two stars was decreasing in perfect alignment with the predictions given by general relativity. This was the first real evidence, albeit indirect, of the existence of gravitational waves, and the discovery of the Hulse-Taylor pulsar was deemed so significant that its discoverers were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1993 \citep{HulseTaylor2}.

Due to the emission of gravitational radiation any binary orbit will eventually decay enough that the two objects collide. As the orbital distance decreases so will the period, resulting in the system emitting gravitational waves at a higher frequency. This will produce a characteristic `chirp' signal until the two objects merge and produce a huge burst of energy \citep{GW_sources, BIGparis}. The more massive the objects in the system the stronger the signal produced, and so the ideal binary systems for gravitational wave detections are binary neutron stars (BNS), binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries. The first detection of gravitational waves, GW150914, was a binary black hole \citep{GW150914}, the `chirp' signals recorded in the LIGO detectors on the 14th of September 2015 are shown in \aref{fig:chirp}.

        }\label{fig:chirp}
\end{figure}

\todo{note strain size, compare to 4km arms etc}

Binary mergers involving neutrons stars are suggested as possible sources of short duration gamma ray bursts (SGRBs) \citep{GW-NSbinaries}. They would also potentially produce kilonovae, from which it might be possible to detect other forms of electromagnetic signal. On the other hand BBH mergers are thought to be unlikely to produce EM emission, as the stellar-mass black holes would not be surrounded by much orbiting matter with which to interact \citep{GW-BHbinaries,GW150914followup}.

As opposed to the continuous sinusoidal waves produced by massive binaries, any particularly cataclysmic astronomical event is thought to produce a burst of gravitational waves. Compact binary mergers are one source of these bursts, but more sudden ones are thought to include be produced in core-collapse supernovae \citep{GW-supernovae}. Unlike binary systems the exact form of GW burst waveforms are unknown. As such gravitational wave detectors are likely to detect new and unexpected sources.

\subsection{Detecting gravitational waves}
\label{sec:gw_detecting}
\begin{colsection}

As described above, gravitational waves manifest as alternately stretching and compressing spacetime along perpendicular axes. The method used for detecting these waves requires observing how two test masses move relative to each other as the wave passes through. This is done using a Michelson interferometer with two long perpendicular arms, as shown in \aref{fig:detector} \citep{BIGbirmingham}. The input laser is split into two by a beam spitter and each beam is sent into one of the arms, where they are reflected multiple times between two mirrored test masses. When they exit the arms the beams are recombined to form a single output. Should the distance either beam travels change relative to the other the change in the resulting interference pattern will be detected. The test masses are suspended by a complex vibration isolation system in order to reduce any outside interference, such as from man-made vibrations or seismic events.

    \caption[A Michelson interferometer used as a gravitational wave detector]{
        A Michelson interferometer used as a gravitational wave detector. As a wave passes through the relative lengths of the arms will change, as shown in the inset, this will reduce or increase the distance the laser light travels through each arm and therefore alter the output interference signal.

        }\label{fig:global}
\end{figure}

Several of these detectors have been built around the world, to give redundancy and improve the localisation of each source. There are currently three active second-generation detectors: two \glsfirst{ligo} detectors at Hanford and Livingston in the United States \citep{LIGO}, and the \glsfirst{ego} Virgo detector in Italy \citep{Virgo}. In addition the older GEO600 detector in Germany is still used primarily as a test system \citep{GEO600}, the Japanese \glsfirst{kagra} is under construction \citep{KAGRA} and in the next decade work should begin on LIGO-India \citep{LIGO_India}. The three current detectors form a global network as the \glsfirst{lvc}, with KAGRA expected to join before the end of 2019 \citep{LIGO-Virgo, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA}.

In the longer term the third generation of larger and more sensitive gravitational wave telescopes is already being planned, including the Einstein Telescope \citep{EinsteinTelescope} and the Cosmic Explorer \citep{CosmicExplorer}. As well space-based detectors are being considered, such as the \glsfirst{lisa} \citep{LISA}, which would be free from the seismic noise limit and therefore could detect lower-frequency gravitational waves.

\todo{GW isn't great at localising on its own}

The obvious difficulty in observing an EM counterpart to a GW detection comes from the poor localisation from the gravitational wave detectors. With multiple detectors it is possible to triangulate the location of the signal using the timing difference between the signal reaching each detector \citep{LIGO-localization,LIGO-localization2}. Two detectors would be able to localize the source to a annulus on the celestial sphere (see the sky maps in Figure \ref{fig:skymap} for an example), whereas three or more will be able to narrow down the candidate to a much narrower area. There are other effects that can assist localisation, such as considering the polarisation of the signal at either detector. It is predicted that even in the case of three detectors the sky localization region will be of the order of tens to hundreds of square degrees \citep{LIGO-prospects}.

\todo{this is worded weirdly}
\todo{more sources?}

The term \emph{multi-messenger} astronomy is often used to describe the search for GW candidates. It emphasises the fact that the hunt is focused on multiple `types' of observation in addition to gravitational wave detections --- across the EM spectrum as well as neutrino detections. The observation of EM counterparts of transient GW sources would provide several scientific benefits \citep{LIGO-EM, LIGO-firstrun-2012}. Most obviously, an EM detection would help massively in the localisation of the source, potentially the identification of a host galaxy and measurement of a redshift. An associated EM observation would also assist with identification of the nature of the source. While a gravitational wave is generated by the motion of the source in spacetime, any EM signal would be produced either from direct outflows or interactions of the matter with the surrounding medium. In the longer term these observations should be useful in determining cosmological parameters such as $H_0$.

\subsection{Finding optical counterparts to gravitational wave detections}
\label{sec:followup}
\begin{colsection}

As the sky map is so large, particularly in the early years of GW detections, the options are either to try and cover as much of the area as possible by using wide field-of-view telescopes or to selectively focus on regions of the sky where the candidate is most likely located.

The `galaxy strategy' optimises the follow-up observations by focusing on any galaxies within the provided sky map \citep{LIGO-galaxys}. Notably this was used by the \emph{Swift} satellite as its X-ray and UV instruments have particularly small fields of view \cite{LIGO-firstrun-Swift,GW150914followup-Swift}. The most important resource for such a strategy is a complete galaxy catalogue, and this will become more of an issue as the sensitivity and therefore range of the advanced detectors increases. The Gravitational Wave Galaxy Catalogue (GWGC) provided a list of galaxies within 100 Mpc \citep{LIGO-GWGC} which has been used in the first follow-up campaigns \citep{LIGO-firstrun-Swift,GW150914followup-Swift}. More work is being done as the catalogues become less complete as the detection range grows higher \citep{LIGO-galaxys,LIGO-galaxys2}.

Even with high field-of-view instruments, there is a great deal of strategy needed for observation prioritising. In most cases the sky is split into multiple fixed `tiles' for optimising observations and comparison to archival images. A GW sky map will cover a certain number of these tiles, and the selection algorithm will need to decide the order to to observe them in \citep{LIGO-tiles-dutch, LIGO-tiles-india}. At its simplest this will rank the tiles by the highest sky map probability contained within. However other considerations include the optimum time for observing based on airmass, the setting time of each tile, the location of the sun and moon, slew time between each observation and so on.

Whenever a gravitational wave is detected a sky map will be sent out to multiple facilities across the Earth (and above it). Therefore it is also important to consider optimisation of the overall EM search effort between multiple institutions \citep{LIGO-optimal,LIGO-optimal2}. Individual groups of institutions in Italy \citep{LIGO-italy} and Australia \citep{LIGO-aus} have already considered such collaborations. \todo{ENGRAVE}

\section{The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer}
\label{sec:goto}
\begin{colsection}

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\begin{colsection}

The \gls{goto}\footnote{\url{https://goto-observatory.org/}} is a project dedicated to detecting future optical counterparts of gravitational wave sources by employing a wide-field approach to be able to localize such counterparts early. The first prototype instrument was inaugurated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma, Canary Islands in July 2017 and is shown in \aref{fig:goto_photo}. \gls{goto} uses arrays of \SI{40}{\cm} \glspl{ut} on a single fast-slewing mount. This modular approach allows the project to scale to large fields of view in a cost-effective manner. A full instrument will have 8 of these \glspl{ut} per mount, giving an overall field of view of \SI{40}{\square\deg} with a pixel scale of \SI[per-mode=symbol]{1.2}{\arcsec\per\pixel} and a limiting magnitude of \about20 in each two minute exposure. Each UT has a set of wide white and coloured filters to assist source characterisation.  An additional instrument with 8 more \glspl{ut} on a second mount is planned to be co-located in a second dome on La Palma, which will double the instantaneous field of view to \SI{80}{\square\deg}, allow the sky to be surveyed at a higher cadence and give more options for transient follow-up. A southern node is also planned for Australia.

    \caption[The GOTO prototype instrument]{
        The GOTO prototype instrument on La Palma, with four of the eventual eight unit telescopes.
    }\label{fig:goto_photo}
\end{figure}

\gls{goto} is designed as a robotic, wide-field transient detection telescope. Under normal circumstances the telescope will carry out an all-sky survey, based on a fixed grid of tiles. Each tile corresponds to the \SI{40}{\square\deg} field of view of the 8 \glspl{ut} observing neighbouring patches of sky, as shown in \aref{fig:tiles}. The all-sky survey will aim to obtain a high-cadence at an appropriate depth, mapping the entire visible sky several times a week. The high cadence will ensure that there are very recent reference images available to allow detection of objects using difference imaging.
