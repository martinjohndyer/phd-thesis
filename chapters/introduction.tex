\section{Gravitational Waves}
\label{sec:gw}

\begin{colsection}

Einstein's theory of General Relativity describes gravity as the curvature of spacetime \citep{Einstein1914}, and he went on to describe the propagation of distortions within the spacetime `fabric' \citep{Einstein1916}. These \emph{gravitational waves} (GWs) are produced by the acceleration of matter within the field of spacetime and propagate at the speed of light, analogous to electromagnetic (EM) waves being produced by a moving charge. The existence of gravitational waves is a consequence of the finite propagation time of gravity in general relativity, there is no analogue to gravitational waves in Newtonian gravity as Newton described a force propagating instantaneously.

The result of Einstein's quadrupole equations is that gravity propagates as a transverse wave, which alternately stretches and compresses spacetime in two orthogonal axes \citep{BIGcardiff}. A single object will never `observe' a gravitational wave, so the only way to detect the passing of gravitational waves is to look for changes in the relative positions of two or more objects. A thought experiment considering the effects of gravitational waves on free-floating masses is shown in \aref{fig:wave}, for the two wave polarisation states.  The magnitude of these perturbations is described as the strain, and it is the goal of gravitational wave detectors to observe these minute spatial perturbations as the wave passes through. A detailed discussion of gravitational wave science is beyond the scope of this thesis, so this section gives merely a brief introduction to the topic in order to explain the core purpose of the GOTO project.

\subsection{Detecting gravitational waves}
\label{sec:gw_detecting}
\begin{colsection}

\begin{figure}[p]

    \caption[A Michelson interferometer used as a gravitational wave detector]{
        A Michelson interferometer used as a gravitational wave detector. As a wave passes through the relative lengths of the arms will change, as shown (highly exaggerated) in the inset. This will reduce or increase the distance the laser light travels through each arm and therefore alter the output interference signal. Adapted from \citet{GW150914_detectors}.
        }\label{fig:detector}
\end{figure}

As described above, gravitational waves manifest as alternately stretching and compressing spacetime along perpendicular axes. The method used for detecting these waves requires observing how two test masses move relative to each other as the wave passes through. This is done using a Michelson interferometer with two long perpendicular arms \citep{BIGbirmingham}, as shown in \aref{fig:detector}. The input laser is split into two by a beam spitter and each beam is sent into one of the arms, where they are reflected multiple times between two mirrored test masses. When they exit the arms the beams are recombined to form a single output. Should the distance either beam travels change relative to the other the change in the resulting interference pattern will be detected. The test masses are suspended by a complex vibration isolation system in order to reduce any outside interference, such as from man-made vibrations or seismic events.

    \caption[Locations of gravitational wave detectors]{
        Locations of current and proposed gravitational wave detectors around the globe.
        }\label{fig:global}
\end{figure}

Several of these detectors have been built around the world, to give redundancy and improve the localisation of each source. There are currently three active second-generation detectors: two \glsfirst{ligo} detectors at Hanford and Livingston in the United States \citep{LIGO}, and the \glsfirst{ego} Virgo detector in Italy \citep{Virgo}. In addition the older GEO600 detector in Germany is still used primarily as a test system \citep{GEO600}, the Japanese \glsfirst{kagra} is under construction \citep{KAGRA} and in the next decade work should begin on LIGO-India \citep{LIGO_India}. The three current detectors form a global network as the \glsfirst{lvc}, with KAGRA expected to join before the end of 2019 \citep{LIGO-Virgo, LIGO-Virgo-KAGRA}.

In the longer term the third generation of larger and more sensitive gravitational wave telescopes is already being planned, including the Einstein Telescope \citep{EinsteinTelescope} and the Cosmic Explorer \citep{CosmicExplorer}. As well space-based detectors are being built, such as the \glsfirst{lisa} \citep{LISA}, which would be free from the seismic noise limit and therefore could detect lower-frequency gravitational waves.

\subsection{Sources of gravitational waves}
\label{sec:gw_sources}
\begin{colsection}

Any accelerating mass will generate gravitational waves as it moves through spacetime, as long as the motion is not spherically symmetric (e.g.\ a rotating disk or a uniformly expanding sphere) \citep{BIGcardiff,BIGparis}. In practice it is impossible to detect gravitational waves from anything but the most massive cosmological objects moving at the fastest speeds, as only they will produce strains that are at all detectable.

A continuous source of gravitational waves will be generated by two massive objects orbiting one another \citep{GW_sources}, and the loss of energy from the system in the form of gravitational waves will slowly cause the orbiting distance of the two objects to shrink. The first binary pulsar was discovered in 1974 \citep{HulseTaylor}, and after repeated observations it was apparent that the orbital period of the two stars was decreasing in perfect alignment with the predictions given by general relativity. This was the first real evidence, albeit indirect, of the existence of gravitational waves, and the discovery of the Hulse-Taylor pulsar was deemed so significant that its discoverers were awarded the Nobel Prize in 1993 \citep{HulseTaylor2}.

Due to the loss of energy in the form of gravitational radiation any binary orbit will eventually decay enough that the two objects collide. As the orbital distance decreases so will the period, resulting in the objects rotating faster and the system emitting gravitational waves at a higher frequencies. This will produce a characteristic `chirp' signal until the two objects merge and produce a huge burst of energy \citep{GW_sources, BIGparis}. The more massive the objects in the system the stronger the signal produced, and so the ideal binary systems for gravitational wave detections are binary neutron stars (BNS), binary black holes (BBH) or neutron star-black hole (NSBH) binaries. The first direct detection of gravitational waves, GW150914, was produced by a binary black hole system \citep{GW150914}. The `chirp' signals recorded in the LIGO detectors on the 14th of September 2015 are shown in \aref{fig:chirp}. Note the fractional strain on the $y$-axis is of the order of $10^{-21}$, meaning the \SI{4}{\kilo\metre}-long LIGO detector arms changed in length by a fraction of the size of a proton.

\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption[The first detection of gravitational waves]{

The expected `chirp' signal characteristic of a binary coalescence is visible --- a wave of increasing frequency that reaches a maximum and then collapses. Adapted from \citet{GW150914}.
        }\label{fig:chirp}
\end{figure}

The LIGO detectors became operational in 2002 and observed on-and-off until 2010 without detecting any gravitational wave signals, when they were taken offline in order to upgrade into Advanced LIGO \citep{LIGO_initial, LIGO_advanced}. The detectors were recommissioned in 2015, and almost immediately detected the first signal, GW150914, as mentioned above \citep{GW150914}. The first LIGO observing run (O1) \glsadd{o1} lasted from September 2015 to January 2016, and during that time two additional signals were detected \citep{LIGO_O1}. All three detections were identified as being produced by coalescing black hole binaries, and although at the time one (LVT151012) was below the $5\sigma$ significance level it has since been upgraded to a significant detection and reclassified as GW151012 \citep{GW_catalog}.

\newpage

The second observing run (O2) \glsadd{o2} took place from November 2016 to August 2017. This run saw the first observation of gravitational waves from a binary neutron star, GW170817 \citep{GW170817}, as well as the addition of the Virgo detector to the network. In total eleven gravitational wave events were detected during O1 and O2, ten from binary black holes and just the one (GW170817) from a binary neutron star \citep{GW_catalog}.

After a few short engineering runs the third observing run (O3) \glsadd{o3} begun on 1 April 2019. At the time of writing it is currently ongoing, and after a short break during October is expected to run until May 2020. This is the first run to include three detectors from the beginning, and KAGRA is expected to join before the end of 2019. This run also marked the start of public alert releases; during O1 and O2 alerts were only released to groups who had signed memoranda of understanding with the LVC (the GOTO Collaboration was one of these groups). In the first 5 months of O3, from the start of April to the end of August 2019, the LVC released 32 alerts\footnote{Public alerts are available at \url{https://gracedb.ligo.org/superevents/public/O3/}}. Of these 7 were ultimately retracted as false alarms, leaving 25 due to real astronomical signals.

As O3 is currently ongoing the LVC has not yet published final values or mass estimates for any of these events. As such they are still treated as candidates, with provisional signal designations and preliminary classification probabilities. Of the 25 non-retracted events 20 are currently classified as originating from binary black hole systems ($P_\text{BBH}>90\%$). Only one is likely from a binary neutron star (S190425z), one is classed as a likely neutron star-black hole binary (S190814bv), and one (S190426c) has an uncertain classification: a 49\% probability as coming from a binary neutron star, 24\% coming from a `MassGap' object (a theorised object with a mass between a neutron star and a black hole) and 13\% from a neutron star-black hole binary (the remaining 14\% is the chance the signal is from a non-astrophysical source, i.e.\ detector noise). The remaining two events both have over 50\% non-astrophysical probability but have not been formally retracted by the LVC.\@

\subsection{On-sky localisation}
\label{sec:gw_localisation}
\begin{colsection}

One problem with the interferometer detectors is that alone they are very poor at localising the direction a signal originates from. It is possible to estimate a rough direction from polarisation of the signal, and the distance to the origin can be estimated from the signal strength, however multiple detectors are really needed to get more accurate sky localisations \citep{GW_localisation, GW_localisation2}. With two detectors the difference between the arrival time of a signal at each allows the direction to the source to be narrowed down, based on the distance between the two detectors and knowing that gravitational waves propagate at the speed of light. However this will only be able to locate the source to a annulus on the celestial sphere perpendicular to the line between the detectors, and as shown in \aref{fig:triangulate} at least three detectors are needed to triangulate the source location. The skymaps for GW170817, shown in \aref{fig:170817_skymaps}, show how the contribution from multiple detectors drastically reduced the on-sky area. Even with the three current detectors sources can typically only be localised to areas of tens to hundreds of square degrees at best, and only if the signal is detected in all three.

\section{Multi-Messenger Astronomy}
\label{sec:multi}
\begin{colsection}

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\begin{colsection}

\emph{Multi-messenger astronomy} refers to detecting multiple astronomical signals from the same source using two or more different `messengers'; including traditional electromagnetic waves/photons, gravitational waves, neutrinos or cosmic rays. An example of a multi-messenger event would be supernova SN 1987A, which was detected by neutrino detectors several hours before becoming visible in the electromagnetic spectrum \citep{SN1987A}. This thesis concentrates on the search for electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave detections, of which at the time of writing only one has been found \citep[GW170817;][]{GW170817}.

Even before GW170817 was detected it had long been theorised that some gravitational wave detections might have electromagnetic counterparts. Binary mergers involving neutrons stars (either neutron star binaries or neutron star-black hole mergers) were suggested as possible source of short duration gamma ray bursts \citep{SGRBs}, and they were expected to produce visible kilonovae \citep{BNSNSBH_EM, BNS_EM}. Electromagnetic counterparts to binary black hole mergers were less expected; binary stellar-mass black holes may not be surrounded by much orbiting matter with which to interact, however certain systems with an orbiting disk might produce enough material for accretion and subsequent emission \citep{BBH_EM}.

\end{colsection}

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\subsection{Benefits of multi-messenger observations}
\label{sec:mma_benefits}
\begin{colsection}

The observation of an electromagnetic counterpart to a transient gravitational wave source would provide several scientific benefits. Firstly, as explained in \aref{sec:gw_localisation}, gravitational wave detectors have only a limited ability to localise the source location. Wide-field electromagnetic monitors, such as the \textit{Fermi} \glsfirst{gbm}, could provide independent localisation skymaps to help reduce the search area \citep[note the \textit{Fermi} skymap included in \aref{fig:170817_skymaps}]{GW170817_GRB}. Direct detection of a visible kilonova would allow precise localisation to a host galaxy, as well as a measure of redshift and therefore the distance to the source.

\newpage

Electromagnetic observations of the counterpart source can give additional insights into the nature of the source objects and their environment, as well as a large number of other scientific breakthroughs. For example, observations of the kilonova associated with GW170817 \citep{GW170817, GW170817_followup} allowed analysis of the equation of state of neutron star material \citep{GW170817_NSscience}, an insight into the origin of heavy metals in the universe \citep{GW170818_heavy}, constraints on the nature of gravity \citep{GW170817_gravity} and a new, independent measurement of the Hubble constant \citep{GW170817_hubble}.

At the time of writing GW170817 remains the only confirmed counterpart to a gravitational wave signal. As LVC observations continue and new detectors come online it is only a matter of time until similar objects are found, which will assuredly lead to further astrophysical and cosmological discoveries. However future counterparts may not be as easy to find.

\end{colsection}

\subsection{Finding optical counterparts to gravitational wave detections}
\label{sec:followup}
\begin{colsection}

GW170817 was a remarkably lucky event in several ways. The gravitational wave signal was observed by both LIGO detectors, and as Virgo was also active at the time its non-detection still helped narrow-down the localisation area to just $31~\text{deg}^2$ \citep[see \aref{fig:170817_skymaps}]{GW170817}. This produced a fairly small skymap that was well positioned for telescopes in the southern hemisphere to observe (although close to sunset). The gravitational wave detection also produced a very low luminosity distance of $40\pm\SI{8}{\mega\parsec}$, which is close enough to be within the high-completeness range of galaxy catalogues.

The first of many observations of the counterpart transient AT 2017gfo was taken by the One-Meter, Two-Hemisphere collaboration using the Swope telescope at Las Campanas Observatory in Chile, which designated it SSS17a \citep{GW170817_Swope}. The Swope telescope only has a field of view of $\SI{30}{\arcmin}\times\SI{30}{\arcmin}$, but due to the small, near-by search area a fairly short list of potential host galaxies could be constructed based on the \glsfirst{gwgc} from \citet{GWGC}. The Swope observations could then be targeted to fields including these galaxies, as shown in \aref{fig:swope_decam}. The host galaxy, NGC 4993, was observed in the ninth pointing.

Five other groups independently observed the same transient within an hour of the Swope observation before the discovery of SSS17a was announced: the Dark Energy Camera \glsadd{decam}\citep[DECam,][]{GW170817_DECam}, the Distance Less Than \SI{40}{\mega\parsec} survey \glsadd{dlt40}\citep[DLT40,][]{GW170817_DLT40}, Las Cumbres Observatory \glsadd{lco}\citep[LCO,][]{GW170817_LCO}, the MASTER Global Robotic Net \citep{GW170817_MASTER} and the \glsfirst{eso} Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy \glsadd{vista}\citep[VISTA,][]{GW170817_VISTA}. The observing strategy differed between groups depending on the field of view of the instruments: DLT40 was an existing supernova survey so targeted already-known galaxies, LCO and VISTA targeted their observations to likely host galaxies like Swope, while DECam and MASTER have larger fields of view and could therefore uniformly observe the entire localisation region using a `tiling' pattern (the DECam tiles are also shown in \aref{fig:swope_decam}).

\begin{figure}[p]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/170817_obs.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption[Follow-up observations of GW170817 with Swope and DECam]{
        Follow-up observations of GW170817 with the Swope telescope and the Dark Energy Camera. The skymap contours and final transient position are the same as in \aref{fig:170817_skymaps}. \\
        Left: The Swope telescope has a small field of view, and so targeted its follow-up observations on concentrations of GWGC galaxies (\textcolorbf{darkgray}{grey} circles).

        }\label{fig:swope_decam}
\end{figure}

The relatively small skymap for GW170817 allowed telescopes with smaller fields of view to efficiently cover the search area, either by targeting galaxies or with a uniform tiling method. However subsequent events have not been as well localised. As detailed in \aref{sec:gw_sources} the second binary neutron star gravitational wave detection, S190425z, occurred a few weeks into O3. This was a single-detector event, observed only by LIGO-Livingston, although Virgo was also observing at the same time. The initial BAYESTAR skymap covered an area of approximately 10,000 square degrees and the final skymap from the LALInference pipeline only reduced this to 7,500~sq~deg, still 250 times the size of the final GW170817 skymap. For searching such large sky areas dedicated wide-field survey telescopes are needed. The \glsfirst{ztf} is one such telescope, with a field of view of 47~sq~deg. Over the first two nights following the S190425z detection ZTF covered approximately 8,000~sq~deg of the initial skymap \citep{GW190425_ZTF}, shown in \aref{fig:ztf}. This still only corresponded to 21\% of the localisation probability, as a large fraction of the skymap was located too close to the Sun to observe.

\begin{figure}[t]
    \begin{center}
        \includegraphics[width=\linewidth]{images/190425.pdf}
    \end{center}
    \caption[Follow-up observations of S190425z with ZTF]{
        Follow-up observations of S190425z with the Zwicky Transient Facility. The ZTF tiled observations are shown in \textcolorbf{NavyBlue}{blue}, over the background BAYESTAR skymap in \textcolorbf{Orange}{orange}. For a size comparison to \aref{fig:swope_decam} the position of the final GW170817 skymap is also shown in \textcolorbf{Green}{green}. Adapted from \citet{GW190425_ZTF}.
        }\label{fig:ztf}
\end{figure}

Even once observations have been taken a robust analysis pipeline is also needed in order to distinguish potential counterpart candidates from the large number of coincident detections. During the S190425z observations ZTF produced nearly 340,000 transient alerts, which were narrowed down to just 12 potential candidates. Ultimately no likely counterpart was identified for this event, by ZTF or other projects.

S190425z was something of an extreme example, and as more gravitational wave detectors come online the typical skymap size should decrease. However it serves as a good counterpoint to the relative ease with which the GW170817 counterpart was found. Small telescopes like Swope can contribute with galaxy-focused observations when the skymap is small enough, but for events like S190425z where large searches are required it is clear that dedicated, wide-field survey telescopes are required to have the best chance of identifying any counterpart.

\section{The Gravitational-wave Optical Transient Observer}
\label{sec:goto}
\begin{colsection}

% ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

\begin{colsection}

The \gls{goto}\footnote{\url{https://goto-observatory.org/}} is a project dedicated to detecting future optical counterparts of gravitational wave sources by employing a wide-field approach to be able to localize such counterparts early. The first prototype instrument was inaugurated at the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory on La Palma, Canary Islands in July 2017 and is shown in \aref{fig:goto_photo}. \gls{goto} uses arrays of \SI{40}{\cm} \glspl{ut} on a single fast-slewing mount. This modular approach allows the project to scale to large fields of view in a cost-effective manner. A full instrument will have 8 of these \glspl{ut} per mount, giving an overall field of view of \SI{40}{\square\deg} with a pixel scale of \SI[per-mode=symbol]{1.2}{\arcsec\per\pixel} and a limiting magnitude of \about20 in each two minute exposure. Each UT has a set of wide white and coloured filters to assist source characterisation.  An additional instrument with 8 more \glspl{ut} on a second mount is planned to be co-located in a second dome on La Palma, which will double the instantaneous field of view to \SI{80}{\square\deg}, allow the sky to be surveyed at a higher cadence and give more options for transient follow-up. A southern node is also planned for Australia.

\begin{figure}[t]

    \caption[The GOTO prototype instrument]{
        The GOTO prototype instrument on La Palma, with four of the eventual eight unit telescopes.
    }\label{fig:goto_photo}
\end{figure}

\gls{goto} is designed as a robotic, wide-field transient detection telescope. Under normal circumstances the telescope will carry out an all-sky survey, based on a fixed grid of tiles. Each tile corresponds to the \SI{40}{\square\deg} field of view of the 8 \glspl{ut} observing neighbouring patches of sky, as shown in \aref{fig:tiles}. The all-sky survey will aim to obtain a high-cadence at an appropriate depth, mapping the entire visible sky several times a week. The high cadence will ensure that there are very recent reference images available to allow detection of objects using difference imaging.
